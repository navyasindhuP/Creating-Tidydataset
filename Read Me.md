Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate create a tidy data set that is used for easy analysis.


Source DATA information: 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

### Files Available in GIT HUB
1) A Read me file that gives and over view about the project called README.md
2) A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
3) A R script explaining the steps performed to create the dataset called run_analysis.R
4) A tidy data set called tidydataset.txt


##### run_analysis.R does the following:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
